##KidsPace
> You know, for kids!  Responsive projection mapping for a child's play space
__________________________

###dev tasks
- [ ] install oF
- [ ] couple oF tutorials 
- [ ] read the oF for Processing tutorials writeup

###Features
####v1.0.0
- converts and aligns 3D world point as viewed by Kinect to a pixel point projected into kidSpace
- projects silhouette of moving objects
- removes background


###Future Features
- touchscreen control (iPad and iPhone)
- create and control virtual shapes
- virtual shapes move autonomously
- shapes respond to movement in the space
- shapes respond to real objects in the space
- projection mapping to objects in the space
- physical interaction with projection mapped objects
- HOT WHEELS TRACKING!
    + RaceTrack Mapping
    + virtual obstructions
    + Car tracking / Car recognition
    + Race winner validation (who entered area x first?)
    + etc etc etc

###oF Dependencies
- [ofxKinectProjectorToolkit]
    + addon for calibrating a projector to a Kinect, allowing for automated projection mapping aligned to the Kinect.
- [ofxOpenNI]
    + The ofxOpenNI module is a wrapper for the openNI + NITE + SensorKinect libraries/middleware for openFrameworks.
- [ofxCv]
    + ofxCv represents an alternative approach to wrapping OpenCV for openFrameworks.
- [ofxSecondWindow]
    + This is a simple openFrameworks addon which allows for creating multiple windows.

##Main Components
###Calibration
###Mapping
+ The key function for mapping is getProjectedPoint(ofVec3f worldPoint). This function takes any 3d world point from the Kinect and converts it to a pixel point. For example, using ofxKinect, the pixel point associated with the world point inside the depth image at (x, y) is found:
```
ofVec3f worldPoint = kinect.getWorldCoordinateAt(x, y);
ofVec2f projectorPoint = kpt.getProjectedPoint(worldPoint);
```
Using ofxOpenNi, the world point is acquired slightly differently, directly from the raw depth pixels.
```
ofShortPixels depthPixels = kinect.getDepthRawPixels();
ofPoint depthPoint = ofPoint(x, y, depthPixels[x +y * kinect.getWidth()]);
ofVec3f worldPoint = kinect.projectiveToWorld(depthPoint);
ofVec2f projectedPoint = kpt.getProjectedPoint(worldPoint);
```
